# Verdant Lens Whitepaper

## Abstract

**Verdant Lens** is a decentralized platform enabling creators on the Lens ecosystem to launch their own personalized tokens through a reputation-gated system. By leveraging bonding curve mechanisms and progressive liquidity migration to Uniswap V2, creators and their communities can participate in economic, reputational, and social growth in a sustainable and gamified way.

---

## 1. Introduction

In the Lens ecosystem, reputation and influence are key drivers of value. **Verdant Lens** empowers top creators to tokenize their presence, letting their supporters back them financially while gaining exclusive access to their communities and rewards.

Verdant Lens introduces:

- A **reputation-gated token launcher**: only users with a Lens Reputation Score > 700 can create tokens.
- A **bonding curve mechanism** to bootstrap liquidity.
- An automatic **migration to Uniswap V2** once liquidity thresholds are met.
- An integrated **XP system** rewarding participants for supporting creators.

---

## 2. Use Cases

Why would someone buy a creatorâ€™s token?

- **Support**: Backing a creator you believe in.
- **Exclusive access**: Token holders can join private groups or channels managed by the creator.
- **Potential appreciation**: Early buyers benefit as token demand grows.
- **Fee-sharing in Uniswap V2**: Once migrated, token holders can provide liquidity in Uniswap V2 and earn trading fees.

## 3. Token Creation

### 3.1 Eligibility

Only Lens users with a **Reputation Score â‰¥ 700** can launch their own token.

Each creator token:

- Is minted through a **sigmoidal bonding curve**.
- Uses **GHO (native stablecoin of Lens Chain)** as the base currency.
- Has a supply dynamically minted by buyers along the bonding curve.

### 3.2 Price Mechanism

The token price follows a **sigmoid bonding curve**:

\[
P(s) = a \cdot \frac{1}{1 + e^{-b(s - c)}}
\]

Where:
- \(P(s)\): price at supply \(s\)
- \(a\): price scaling factor
- \(b\): steepness
- \(c\): midpoint

Early tokens are cheaper; price accelerates with supply.

**All purchases are made in GHO.** Collected GHO is locked in the bonding curve contract to back liquidity.

---

## 4. Migration to Uniswap V2

Once a creator's token reaches a preset liquidity threshold (e.g., **5,000 GHO locked**), it is:

1. Migrated automatically to a **Uniswap V2 pool (TOKEN/GHO)**.
2. Uses locked GHO and corresponding token supply as initial liquidity.
3. Allows public trading and liquidity provision by users.

### ðŸ’¡ Key difference:

During the bonding curve phase:
- Buy/sell interacts directly with the curve contract.

After migration:
- Buy/sell happens via **Uniswap V2 AMM**, enabling fee-sharing for LPs.
